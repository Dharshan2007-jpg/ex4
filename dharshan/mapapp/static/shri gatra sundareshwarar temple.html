 The *Shri Kathra Sundareswarar Temple, located in **Kanjanagaram* near Mayiladuthurai, is one of the most significant Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu, especially revered as the Parihara Sthalam (remedial site) for those born under the *Krithika (Karthikai) star*.
  Lord Shiva here graces as a Swayambhu Lingam (self-manifested deity) facing the rare West direction. The Goddess, *Thunga Bala Sthanambigai, holds a unique significance as she is seen with a parrot, believed to be Lord Shiva Himself reciting the Vedas (*Veda Amirtha Keeram). The temple is also the birthplace of *Manakkanjarar, one of the 63 Nayanmars, and is linked to the origin of Lord Muruga (Karthikeya) from the six sparks (*Kathra Jyoti) of Lord Shiva's eye.
