 *Sembanarkoil* is a historic and culturally rich panchayat town located in the Mayiladuthurai district of *Tamil Nadu*. 
 The town is famous for the *Swarnapureeswarar Temple* (known as Semponnarkoil), which is one of the *Pancha Krosha Sthalams* and a sacred place dedicated to Lord Shiva. 
 The name 'Semponnarkoil' literally means the 'Temple of Red Gold' and refers to the legend that the main deity was made of red gold. 
 Surrounded by lush paddy fields, Sembanarkoil is a tranquil place that serves as a center for local commerce, traditional crafts, and agricultural activities, preserving the ancient heritage of the region.
