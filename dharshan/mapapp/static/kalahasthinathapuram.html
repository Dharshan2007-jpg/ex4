 *Kalahasthinathapuram* is a village located in the Tharangambadi Taluk of the Nagapattinam district, Tamil Nadu. It is a place of agricultural importance and traditional life. The village is spiritually significant due to its association with a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, locally known as *Sri Kalahasteeswara Swamy*.
 Devotees believe that praying at this ancient shrine is equivalent to offering prayers at the famous Sri Kalahasti temple in Andhra Pradesh, giving it immense religious importance. The temple is considered a *Vaayu Sthalam* and is a revered spot for removing the Kaala Sarpa Dosham, attracting pilgrims seeking divine blessings. The area reflects the deep-rooted cultural and devotional practices of the region.
