 Sembanarkoil is also home to a number of powerful temples, including the sacred shrine of *Arulmigu Angala Parameshwari Amman. This ancient temple, often referred to as **Angalamman Koil*, is situated close to the main town and is a major center for the worship of the Goddess of Protection.
 The temple is renowned for its annual *Mayanakkollai festival*, which is celebrated with great fervor on the day following Mahashivarathri. Devotees gather for this unique ritual to seek the powerful blessings of the Amman. The temple reflects the deep-rooted tradition of Sakthi (Goddess) worship in the region, drawing pilgrims who come to pray for health, prosperity, and protection from all forms of adversity.
