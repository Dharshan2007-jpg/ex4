 Sembanarkoil is also home to a number of powerful temples, including the sacred shrine of *Arulmigu Angala Parameshwari Amman. This ancient temple, often referred to as **Angalamman Koil*, is situated close to the main town and is a major center for the worship of the Goddess of Protection.
 The temple is renowned for its annual *Mayanakkollai festival*, which is celebrated with great fervor on the day following Mahashivarathri. Devotees gather for this unique ritual to seek the powerful blessings of the Amman. The temple reflects the deep-rooted tradition of Sakthi (Goddess) worship in the region, drawing pilgrims who come to pray for health, prosperity, and protection from all forms of adversity.

 *Kalahasthinathapuram* is a village located in the Tharangambadi Taluk of the Nagapattinam district, Tamil Nadu. It is a place of agricultural importance and traditional life. The village is spiritually significant due to its association with a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, locally known as *Sri Kalahasteeswara Swamy*.
 Devotees believe that praying at this ancient shrine is equivalent to offering prayers at the famous Sri Kalahasti temple in Andhra Pradesh, giving it immense religious importance. The temple is considered a *Vaayu Sthalam* and is a revered spot for removing the Kaala Sarpa Dosham, attracting pilgrims seeking divine blessings. The area reflects the deep-rooted cultural and devotional practices of the region.

 The *Shri Kathra Sundareswarar Temple, located in **Kanjanagaram* near Mayiladuthurai, is one of the most significant Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu, especially revered as the Parihara Sthalam (remedial site) for those born under the *Krithika (Karthikai) star*.
  Lord Shiva here graces as a Swayambhu Lingam (self-manifested deity) facing the rare West direction. The Goddess, *Thunga Bala Sthanambigai, holds a unique significance as she is seen with a parrot, believed to be Lord Shiva Himself reciting the Vedas (*Veda Amirtha Keeram). The temple is also the birthplace of *Manakkanjarar, one of the 63 Nayanmars, and is linked to the origin of Lord Muruga (Karthikeya) from the six sparks (*Kathra Jyoti) of Lord Shiva's eye.
